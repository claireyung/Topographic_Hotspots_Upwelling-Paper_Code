This repository contains code used in the analysis and presentation of my thesis, Topographic Hotspots of Southern Ocean Upwelling (2021)

Analysis_Code has the code used to bin data into density bins, create along-contour transport calculations, calculate energy conversion terms etc.

Figure_Code has the code used to create figures, labelled by their number in the thesis.

Requires: cosima cookbook, data access to NCI where ACCESS-OM2-01 model output is used.

Note schematics and annotations were made using Adobe Illustrator.
